            <p>Dave came to me looking for technical expertise to make his vision a reality. He already had a strong concept for how he wanted his website to lok and function, but needed someone to implement his idea.</p>
            <p>With such a strong vision already figured out, it was my job to work through the technical implementation. By leveraging a scrolling wall JavaScript library, I was able to build him the experience he was looking for.</p>
            <p>Since my solution was heavily JavaScript-based, I wanted this project to be a good exploration of ES6 features. From template literals, const/let, and arrow functions, I wrote a good chunk of my Javascript using ES6.</p>
            <p>The website I built allows Dave to creatively share his photography with the world, and it allowed me to continue exploring the ever-changing landscape of modern JavaScript.</p>
