A plugin for [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) that allows a user to bring in an extensive list of their Stripe data into a Gatsby site. This allows for the creation of an e-commerce dashboard app coupled with the performance and security benefits of a static site.

This, and the other plugins I've created for Gatsby, are my ongoing foray into contributing to open-source projects. These projects have helped familiarize myself with what it takes to maintain an open source NPM package that others rely on: answering and resolving issues, keeping dependencies up to date, and updating the plugin as both Gatsby and Stripe evolve.
