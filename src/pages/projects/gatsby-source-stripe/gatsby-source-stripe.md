A plugin for [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) that allows a user to bring in an extensive list of their Stripe data into a Gatsby site. This allows for the creation of an e-commerce dashboard app coupled with the performance and security benefits of a static site.

This, and the other plugins I've created for Gatsby, are my first foray into contributing to an open source project. These projects have helped familiarize myself with what it takes to maintain an open source NPM package that others rely on: answering and resolving issues, keeping dependencies up to date, and updating the plugin as both Gatsby and Stripe evolve.
