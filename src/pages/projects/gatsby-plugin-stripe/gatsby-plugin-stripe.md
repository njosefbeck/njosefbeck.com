A plugin for [Gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org) that adds the necessary [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) JavaScript files, to bring e-commerce functionality to a Gatsby static site. This, and the other plugins I've created for Gatsby, are my ongoing foray into contributing to open-source projects. These projects have helped familiarize myself with what it takes to maintain an open source NPM package that others rely on: answering and resolving issues, keeping dependencies up to date, and updating the plugin as both Gatsby and Stripe evolve.
