The purpose of Unicorn Mart was to showcase a static site use case that typically falls in the traditional CMS or database-driven site realm: an e-commerce store. But now, with services like Contentful, AWS Lambda, and the serverless framework, it's possible to use a static site generator like GatsbyJS to build out an e-commerce solution. Unicorn Mart is a proof of concept of this in action.
