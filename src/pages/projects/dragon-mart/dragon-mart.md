The purpose of Dragon Mart was to showcase a static site use case that typically falls in the traditional CMS or database-driven site realm: an e-commerce store. Dragon Mart is an updated version of my other project, Unicorn Mart. This version uses Stripe's own inventory management system for the content, Stripe's updated Checkout integration, and my Gatsby Stripe plugins.
