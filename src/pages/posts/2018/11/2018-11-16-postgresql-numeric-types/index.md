In my [last post](/2018/11/postgresql-create-table), I briefly went over the syntax used to create a table in PostgreSQL. When specifying the columns for your table, you need to specify the data type that can go in each column. But, what are all these data types, and how do you decide which one to use? This series of posts will explore the different data types supported in PostgreSQL. 

This post acts as an index for the numeric data type articles. Choose from the list below to learn more about each numeric data type.
