Just a quick note to say that I've updated the projects showcased here. I've removed some, and added some. I've also updated all the photos, so that they look nicer.

These past few months have been busy with a new job, and also with a lot of new learning. Been doing a lot of work with React Hooks at my job, have started dabbling with Go, and am going through a course on Flutter at the moment. Very excited to share with you all what I build with these new languages and SDKs!

As always, thanks for reading. Reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/njosefbeck">Twitter</a> if you want to chat. :)
